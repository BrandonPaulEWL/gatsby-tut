An enfleurage is a method to extract the aroma of flowers into a usable oil base. This base can be used as-is, depending on your carrier oil of choice, or mixed into a formulation in the oil phase (again depending on the carrier base used). In this recipe we recommend using Babassu Oil or Coconut Oil.

While essential oils are amazing for creating beautiful scent profiles, sometimes the most desirable scents like lilac and lily are just not available as essential oils. With an enfleurage, you can extract those lovely aromas into oil that would otherwise be created from either essential oil isolate blends, like our natural fragrance oils, or synthetically.
